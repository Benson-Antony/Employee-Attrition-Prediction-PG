# Employee Attrition



Attrition is the silent killer, capable of destabilizing even the most successful and stable organizations in a remarkably short period of time.
Hiring new personnel is a highly difficult task that demands capital, time, and expertise.Also, hiring a new employee costs significantly more than that person's wage.

- Hiring an employee costs far more than simply their salary; it also includes recruiting, training, benefits, and other expenses.
- In 2019, the average small business spent more than $1,500 on training per employee.
- Integrating a new employee into the firm can take time and money.
- It can take six months or longer for a corporation to recoup its investment in a new hire.

In this project, I created a Machine Learning Model to predict employee attrition using a variety of Machine Learning Algorithms.
Exploratory data analysis was performed utilizing a variety of data visualization tools.

Using Logistic Regression, we achieved high accuracy on the Kaggle dataset 'IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance'.
